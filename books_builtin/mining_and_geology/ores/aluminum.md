## Bauxite

The most industrially important aluminum ore.

"As of 2010, approximately 70% to 80% of the world's dry bauxite
production is processed first into alumina and then into aluminium by
electrolysis" (Wikipedia)

Once converted to Aluminum Oxide (Al2O3), it is dissolved in molten
Cryolite (Na3AlF6) at 960C.  An electric current is then run through
it, which produces elemental aluminum.  This is are the last few
steps of the Bayer process.

## Corundum

Corundum is Aluminum Oxide (Al2O3), so it should be possible to dissolve
it in molten cryolite directly (as described for Bauxite, per the
Bayer process).  You will probably get many impurities as well if it
is not somehow filtered first, but this may be easier than converting
Bauxite to Al2O3.
