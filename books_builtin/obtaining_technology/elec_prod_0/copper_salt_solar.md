# Solar using Copper and Salt Water

## Why you wouldn't use regular solar panels

Generally, if you have normal solar panels, you're going to use them.
But if you don't have them, and you can't find any, making them is
practically out of the picture.

Making solar panels using silicon requires growing doped silicon
crystals, which is anything but simple.  It requires melting silicon,
which happens at 1410 celsius, and adding boron or phosphorous dopants.
This process obviously requires sophisticated industry.  Furthermore,
normal solar panels last only about 25 years.

## Drawbacks of the Cu2O solar cell described

This cell's main property is that it's easy to make.  It is extremely
inefficient, and will not power your home unless you have acres of these
cells.  You will not power electric heaters, A/C, refrigerator, or other
power-hungry devices off of this.

Because of this, you will mainly either:
A. Be saving your electricity for something specific that calls for it,
or B. using it to power small devices like cellphones or laptops, or
something else that requires small amounts of power.

This technology should be used as a bridge before getting more advanced
energy sources, like wind, chemical sources, hydro power, or other.

## A Simple Photovoltaic

#### Materials Needed

1. Copper sheet (preferably) or a copper fabric
2. Salt, kosher salt, or baking soda (further called 'electrolyte')
3. Water
4. A flat and wide watertight container, like a pan
5. Wires, with insulation - preferably made of copper or CCA
6. A heat source (blowtorch, very very hot fire, etc)
7. Something for grinding, like sandpaper or a rock
8. A clip or other 

#### Building a Primitive Solar Cell

1. Heat the copper sheet or mesh until the entire surface turns a more
   reddish-pinkish color
2. Cool the sheet back to normal temperature
3. Grind the suface of a small section on an edge of the sheet, such that
   metallic copper is revealed.
4. Mix the electrolyte into the water until no more electrolyte will
   dissolve
5. Place the copper sheet into the container, facing toward the top of
   the container
6. Bend the grinded side of the copper to go up and out of the container
7. Pour in the electrolyte-filled water into the container
8. Connect one wire to the grinded part of the copper
9. Place another wire into the salt water

Now you have your cell.  The wire connected to the copper is the
positive end, and the wire in the water is the negative end.

If you have a big enough sheet of glass, it's good to cover the
container with it to slow down the water evaporating out.  From time
to time the water will need to be refilled.
